Description: Linear factor model fitting for asset returns (three major types-
    time series, fundamental and statistical factor models); related risk
    (volatility, VaR and ES) and performance attribution (factor-contributed vs
    idiosyncratic returns); tabular displays of risk and performance reports;
    factor model Monte Carlo, single and multiple imputation methods for 
    simulating returns and backfilling unequal histories. The package authors 
    would like to thank S&P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE for kindly contributing 
    fundamental data on 300 publicly traded companies to this open source package. 
    Commonly referred to as "alpha factors" or "scores", the variables are 
    generously provided for educational use with functions contained in this 
    FactorAnalytics package.
