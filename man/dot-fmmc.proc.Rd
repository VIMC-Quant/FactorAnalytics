\details{
This method takes in data, factors and residual type. It then does the following
1. Fit a time series factor model to the data using user supplied selection and
   fit variables or it defaults them to stepwise and OLS respectively. If any
   of the betas are NA then the corresponding factors are dropped
2. If the residual type beisdes empirical is specified then it fits the
   corresponding distribution to the residuals and simulates from the fitted 
   distribution. The number of NA's in the simulated sample are the same as
   original residuals.
3. It then merges factors and non-NA residuals for each asset to create a full
   outer join of the factors and residuals. We use this joined data to create new
   simulated returns. Returns together with factors define a joint emperical density.
